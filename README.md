# Java-Code-of-Database-Query-Execution

The Code is for practice purpose. The application is based on console input output scenario. The project has databsase files name as music.db. I have worked on importing database into application using JDBC driver. The file has methods implementing Queries for artist table in music database.

The whole work was done with Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

#Thanks! Happy Programming.
